## Add two new items from the web pages we read for this week to your new collect. 

Your two items should relate to each other in a way that your find historically significant based on our readings. At the end of this assignment you are asked to write an analysis of your two items, so you may wish to review the writing assignment before selecting your items. 

[Met Museum Mauryan Collection](http://www.metmuseum.org/search-results#!/search?q=mauryan) Open at least ten images and note their commonalities and differences.

[Hellenistic Art](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/haht/hd_haht.htm) Read introductory text on web page and view slide show, reading captions on images.

[Africans in Ancient Greek Art](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/afrg/hd_afrg.htm) Read introductory text on web page and view slide show, reading captions on images.

## 6. Save and upload an image of your object to your two new items. 

Once you find an image on the museum website. right click on the image to "Save image" on your computer. Once you've saved the image, you can upload the image to Omeka as part of your item by clicking on the "Files" tab and then clicking on "Choose File."  That will bring up a file dialog box that let's you chose your saved image from wherever you saved it on your computer.

## 7. Paragraph analysis## 

Historical art serves many purposes: it may impress us with its beauty, convey to us the technological standards of the day, or tell a broad story about what life was like when the art was created. 

You are to write a a one paragraph (175-250 words) analysis of two objects you've chosen. What do your two objects tell us about everyday life in the period you've selected? 

Please be specific: choosing two Buddhua sculptures and then arguing that people in the past were religious is like choosing a cup of water and saying water is an essential component of life: true but useless. If you took your 16 year old cousin to a museum that had your two objects sitting side by side, what would you  say if he gave you the "so who cares about these dumb things" line? 

Include your completed paragraph in the Dublin Core Standard "Description" box in Omeka for both the items you've chosen. 

I suggest you compose your paragraph outside Omeka and cut and paste the text into the "Description" box when you are happy with it. 


### 8. Grading Criteria###

1. Student added an image to an item in Omeka. 
* Student correctly added data from a museum website to an online exhibit following the Dublin Core Standards. 
* Student created a collection in Omeka and correctly named that collection. 
* Student wrote a thesis statement that was provable, non-obvious, and connected the two different pieces of art in her/his collection. 
* Student used evidence to support your thesis statement. 
* Student included a statement in their paragraph about what you wish to learn from this lesson. Your learning objective should be doable and you should be able to grade yourself on it. For example, "I wish to review what makes a thesis statement strong" is a strong learning objective. "I want to know more about art" is not knowable or gradable.

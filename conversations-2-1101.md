## Write and tag your post. 

Your post should be fewer than 500 words, including all quotations and citations for any images.

You do not need to post images to earn an A, but you do need to post links to your contemporary source and your historical primary source.

A composition window, very similar to Microsoft Word, will pop up and let you write you post. To add a link to your text, highlight the text and hit command and K (Mac) and CRTL and K (Windows) to make that word a link. Or you can click on the “Insert/edit link” button.(1)

Your post should do the following things:

* Explain your two sources to a general audience. 
* Explain how your two sources relate to each other 
* Explain what issue the two sources raise for you. 
* Explain what is interesting about this issue as it relates to a Minnesotan. 

Style guide: Your post should be conversational, much like you'd talk to a friend and a coffee shop. You don't start conversations with “In this conversation I argue that . . .” or finish friendly chats with “In conclusion, points, a, b, and c all point to . . .” Nor do you speak in bullet points. You tell a story. See my example on the blog (all the way at the start of the blog) for conversational style.

Be sure to give your post a title.(2) 

Please tag your post (tagging is adding a keyword) on the left hand side. Please add "1101 online" or "1101 face-to-face" as your tag.

## Publish your post. 

Once you've written, edited, titled, and tagged your post, click on "Publish" to add your post to the blog. 

Note: I use this blog for multiple classes, you'll see blog entries on industrialization from other students.

## Time to complete

I expect it should take you about an hour to find two sources that work well together, another hour to figure out how to write an interesting post, and two hours to write, edit, and publish your post. 

## Don't miss!

This is as close to traditional history paper as you get in this class. 500 words is about two pages, which is not easy to write well. Give yourself time. When students have succeeded on this assignment in the past is when they broke it into chunks and worked and though about it over an entire week. Students that dumped a couple of hastily found sources into a rambling "this is what I think about things on the internet" have struggled to earn decent grades.

## 5. Inside the editor. 

* Now that your are in the the editor, review the readings for this week on the Ramayana, Zoroastrianism, and the Code of Hammurabi. Search the web for three, different, credible websites related to these three subjects. Remember the PISA test (Publication, Institution, Sources, Author). 

* For our work in Omeka, we will focus on four themes in history: _ideas, organizing people, material culture, and gender._ Chose an item from your researched websites that relates to one of these themes. 

* Create a New Record for each of your three items using the edit page and clicking on "New Record."

## 7. In the "Body" box, click on "Edit HTML". That will bring up an HTML editor that looks like this:

* Post the link to the website you found that relates to the _Ramayana, Zoroastrianism, and the Code of Hammurabi_  that relates to how people dealt with scarcity (poverty) in Babylon, India, and Persia. 

* In the "Body" html editing box, write a short analysis (75 words) of why you believe the website linked will contribute to the classes understanding of ancient Babylon, India, or Iran. _Be sure to sign your name in the "Body" box for each of your entries._

* Review each of your three new entries for accuracy (date, geographic placement, link, full analysis). You may wish to play with the graphic design to distinguish your points from other students. 

* Write a learning goal (what I want to learn from this lesson) in the text box.

## 8. How am I to find credible websites?

There are a couple of different techniques. You may have learned different acronyms for testing the credibility of a website. One of my favorites is Mike Caufield's [four moves](https://webliteracy.pressbooks.com/chapter/four-strategies/) to evaluate sources. The ability to evaluate the credibility of information is likely the most important skill you'll learn in college.
